```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load-data}

Need to pivot_longer() to make single vector with "hurricane)
```{r}
goog_longer <- pivot_longer(data = google,
             cols = 2:5,
             names_to = "hurricane",
             values_to = "trends")
```


```{r}
ggplot(goog_longer, aes(date, trends)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = hurricane)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = hurricane,
                 shape = hurricane))
```

Visualize with solid shapes NEED TO DOOOOO
```{r}
ggplot(goog_longer) +
  geom_point(aes(date, trends, 
                 color = hurricane,
                 shape = hurricane)) #Is this what he means by visualizing with solid shapes?

?geom_ribbon
ggplot(goog_longer, aes(date)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax=trends, fill = hurricane)) #or is this what he wants?
```

Visualize the same relation, but change the scales so color is mapped to a continuous scale (the other scales should be discrete).
```{r}
ggplot(goog_longer) +
  geom_point(aes(hurricane, date,
                 color = trends), size = 3) # is this what he is looking for?
```

Make DataFrame
```{r}
id <- 1:4
hurricane_name <- c("Harvey", "Irma","Jose", "Maria")
landfall <- as.Date(c("2017-08-25", "2017-09-10", "NA", "2017-09-20"))
df <- data.frame(id, hurricane_name, landfall)
```

Add Vline
```{r}
ggplot(goog_longer, aes(date, trends)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = hurricane)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = df$landfall) #Still need to figure out how to either make them match the colors of goog_longer$hurricane or to add labels to the vlines
```
